### Heart Disease Prediction
A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.

#### Research Question
This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression

#### Data Sources
This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is less or more. Using the information explore the dataset and classify the target variable using different Machine Learning models and findout which algorithm suitable for this dataset.

#### Methodology
The Techniques Expected to Use
  Data Analysis
  Data Preparation
  ML Models
  Logistic Regression
  K-Nearest Neighbour
  Decision Tree
  Support Vector Machine


#### Results
Following are the factors contributing to heart disease

Model Accuracy

Logistic Regression 84.669811
Naive Bayes 81.957547
Random Forest 83.726415
Extreme Gradient Boost 83.726415
K-Nearest Neighbour 83.962264
Decision Tree 82.193396
Support Vector Machine 84.551887
Looking at the model accuracy score, Logistic Regression performed the best for this dataset.

Ensembling using StackingCVClassifier did not affect the model performance significantly.

#### Next steps
From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million die from heart attack. The medical study says that human lifestyle is the main reason behind this heart problem.
Apart from this there are many key factors which warn that the person may/maynot get a chance of heart attack. Using the machine learning models it can predict the risk of heart disease. Using regression models, it can predict the factors contributing to heart disease.
