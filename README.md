 1. The Research Question
    
This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression

2. Expected Data Source(s)
   
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. 
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

3. The Techniques Expected to Use
  Data Analysis
  Data Preparation
  ML Models
  Logistic Regression
  K-Nearest Neighbour
  Decision Tree
  Support Vector Machine

5. Models Evaluation

6. The Expected Results
Using the information, explore the dataset and classify the target variable using different Machine Learning models and find out which algorithm is suitable for this dataset to predict the accurate result.

7. Why This Question Is Important
From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million die from heart attack. The medical study says that human lifestyle is the main reason behind this heart problem.
Apart from this there are many key factors which warn that the person may/maynot get a chance of heart attack. Using the machine learning models it can predict the risk of heart disease. Using regression models, it can predict the factors contributing to heart disease.
